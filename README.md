This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## What it Does?

- It takes your email, username and password and saves it on the `localStorage`. This project is not currently connected to Backend, but is highly expected to become fully functional any time soon.
- This is a responsive application optimized for mobile phones.

Open (http://password-manager-five-beta.vercel.app/) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
